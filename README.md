# Reflection

I chose to make this into a SPA because I wanted it to feel like an app. All the pages are preloaded
and the content is populated as the AJAX calls are completed. Bootstrap was used for styling as it allowed for rapid development of this idea, and because many of the components worked well for my needs.
